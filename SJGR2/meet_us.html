      <p> It's us! Just four 'wise before our years' film nerds chatting shit about the films that we love, the films that we loathe, the films we've seen, and the films we simply can't wait to see. We're all connected by a love of the cinematic arts, a common local (namely the beautiful city of Bath), and one Mr Sam Chapter.</p>
      <p> So keep reading for tales of suspense and daring, or just more shit about movies (We can't help it. It's what we love to do).</p>
